# Docker images for building yabridge

This repository contains Dockerfiles that can be used to build
[yabridge](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge) under Ubuntu LTS releases.
This is needed because older Ubuntu releases don't contain some of the
dependencies needed to compile yabridge. See the [GitHub
workflows](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/tree/master/.github/workflows)
directory in the main repository for more information on how these are used. The
built images can be found on [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/robbert/docker-yabridge).
